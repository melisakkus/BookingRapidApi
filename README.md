# Hotel Reservation Project with RapidApi

BookingRapidApi is designed as a hotel listing platform where users can search for hotels based on various criteria and easily compare and view the most suitable options. Users can perform hotel searches using different filters such as location and number of guests. The results are presented in a simple and clear table format. This table includes the following information:

• Hotel Name

• Number of Reviews

• Image (Photo)

• User Rating

This allows users to easily compare different hotels and select the most suitable option.

Data Source: Data is retrieved in real-time through the Booking API integrated via RapidAPI and dynamically presented to the user without page refresh using AJAX (jQuery) technology.
